         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Here by the way, you ſee the errors of almoſt all Writers in Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy; ſome hold the heart of man is firſt formed, and that forms all the reſt of the parts; others hold, the Liver is firſt formed, and performs the ſame office; when indeed the one is as true as the other, yet both of them falſe, for it is the Microcoſmical Sun is firſt formed in the body; and doth all.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. The Coeleſtiall Sun gives a vital Seed, and ſtirs up all to motion and action, dryeth, cheriſheth, quickeneth, defendeth, and preſerveth what it hath quickened, neither ſuffers he that which dyes, everlaſtingly to dye, nor that which is killed, never to live again.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Moon ſubminiſters moyſture to perfect and finiſh all this, and this is that which is called radicall moyſture in the body of man, <hi>viz.</hi> the Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſmicall Moon. We confeſſe many have talked and written of radicall moyſture, but few underſtand what it is; this preſerveth the Elements and Elementary bodies from the ſcorching heat which motion cauſeth, and ſo temperateth the beams of the Sun, that they may not be extreme, that they may ſerve for conſervation, and not for deſtruction.</p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:170870:50"/>
                     <p n="5">5. Becauſe the beams of the Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall Sun and Moon, cannot paſſe to the Elementary world, but by a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, <hi>viz.</hi> the Air, that's the reaſon Animals muſt needs breath, and all Vegetables and Minerals have an Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall ſpirit in them.</p>

                     <p n="7">7. Then conſider, that as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocoſmicall Sun and Moon make uſe of other parts of the body to aſſiſt them in their office, as the ventricles of the

                     <p>The moſt probable cauſe of the Brain-ſickneſſes of our age, we ſhall ſhew you in the next Book; however, we conſulted together which was the beſt way to obtain that knowledge which hath now been a long time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt loſt in the world; and that we might proceed methodically in this, wee propounded two wayes to our
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170870:53"/>ſelves, whereby we might come to finde out the truth; thoſe that account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves learned, call the firſt an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>à priore,</hi> and the ſecond an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument <hi>à poſteriore.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">I. We went to School to Nature, to ſee which way things were made in a Naturall way, and guided being made; and we ſuppoſed, that way we might come to know their Natures, by knowing of what matter, and by what means they were made.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. We viewed the ſignatures in things that were made, we ſearched if that we might finde their Natures thereby; we perceived work enough in this for a man to buſie his head about all the dayes of his life, and yet learn ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing every day.</p>
                     <p>We have heard of ſome that will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake (and they ſay, perform what they undertake) to tell a man what his diſeaſes be, by the view of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. We confeſſe our ſelves either
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170870:54"/>through want of age, or experience, or ſomething elſe, are not able alwayes to do it, yet we really beleeve it may be done; becauſe,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. We have read of a Phyſician that knew a young Prince was in love with his Mother in Law, becauſe his pulſe alwayes moved ſwifter when ſhe was in his preſence. It ſeems all Creatures have their proper beams as the Stars of heaven have.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. We have read in <hi>Alkindus</hi> in his Treatiſe <hi>de Radiis,</hi> where he affirms, that every thing in the Elementary world contains its <hi>ſpecies</hi> in it ſelfe; for it is manifeſt, that every thing in this world, whether it be a Subſtance, or whether it be an Accident, caſteth out its beams as the Stars do, or elſe it had not the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Starry world in it ſelfe. The Fire (as it is moſt manifeſt) caſteth out its beams to a certain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. The Earth ſends out its beams of cold, of health, and of medicine;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170870:54"/>and medicines taken into the body, or outwardly applyed to the body, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe their beams through the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of him that receives them; and every coloured body ſendeth out its beams, by which it is perceived of what colour it is; whence it appears to be an apparent truth, that every thing which hath actuall exiſtence in the Elementary world ſends forth its beams, which fill the Elementary world after their own manner; and every place of this world contains the beams of all things, which are actually exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent in every place; and as every thing differeth from another, ſo the beams of every thing differ in effect, and nature from the beams of all other things; by which it comes to paſſe that the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the beams is divers in all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things.</p>
                     <p>Much more <hi>Alkindus</hi> ſpeaks, which for brevity ſake we ſhall omit; yet the truth of this we conceive can be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to no man that doth but conſider that he may ſmell many things when
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170870:55"/>he ſeeth them not; and then we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you but ſoberly to conſider, that if the beams and ſignatures of Hearbs and Plants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have their ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, muſt not the beams of the Sun, Moon, and Stars have much more, ſeeing they cauſe the variety and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the other, as Spring and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Autumne and Winter evidently declare.</p>
                     <p>We have been very long upon gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls, yet nothing is tedious which is rationall.</p>
                     <p>We come now to ſpeak of the Sun particularly, therefore we intreat you to conſider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Sun gives vitall heat to the whole Univerſe, to all and every part of the Creation.</p>
                     <p>By the Coeleſtial Sun was the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trall Sun in the Earth kindled, and alſo the Microcoſmicall Sun in the Body of Man.</p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:170870:55"/>
                     <p n="2">2. This Sun by his vitall heat quickens moyſture, heat and moyſture ſo quickened is the cauſe of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of all things are bred by heat and moyſture.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Though it be true, that radical moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure comes from the Moon, as we ſhall cleerly prove in the next Chapter; yet it is as true that it comes principally from her when ſhe receives the full beams of the Sunne, as is palpably and apparently ſeen not onely in all ſhell-fiſhes, but alſo in the marrow both of men and beaſts.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. For as the Sun when he is up enlightens all the Hemiſphere, and this light departs again when he is down; ſo our life remains ſo long as the Coeleſtiall Sun quickens the Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſmicall Sun; but when either the Coeleſtiall Sun fails in that office, or elſe the veſſell that holds the Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſmicall
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170870:56"/>Sun is broken, life departs, and man dyes.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. And this alſo is very agreeable to reaſon, that the Coeleſtiall Fire ſhould have ſome center, from whence it ſhould quicken, cheriſh, inſpire, and move the Creation; it muſt have its place where he may keep his Court like a King, that ſo the Sons of Wiſdome, reall Philoſophers, ſuch as preferre a drachm of knowledge before the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the whole world, may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed where to goe, and how, and which way by Art to help Nature in her operations; therefore the Eternall God, in mere mercy to mankinde, fixed its center in the Sun, that ſo his creatures which fear him, and hate covetouſneſſe, when they want vitall heat to quicken either themſelves or their operations, they may know where to fetch it, if they know but how; and that they may eaſily know, if they doe but know themſelves; it was not for nothing that wiſe <hi>Greek</hi>
                        <pb n="89" facs="tcp:170870:56"/>ſo often exhorted men to know themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. We ſhall be yet a little plainer with you, doe but ſeriouſly take notice of the common operations of the Sun, <hi>viz.</hi> how in Winter he prepares the Earth for Spring; in Spring, how he prepares it for Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; in Summer, how he prepares it for Autumn; and in Autumn, how he prepares it for Winter: Nay, do but note how dayes-labour prepares a man for night-ſleep, and night-ſleep for dayes-labour: Heed but this with the eye of Reaſon, for plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then this thou ſhalt never be taught.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Take notice that all operations are perfected by the Sun, not upon a ſudden, but by degrees, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire time and patie ce.</p>
                     <p>You ſee the Sun makes it day by degrees, and changes the ſeaſons of the yeers by degrees, and that's the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170870:57"/>the reaſon all ſudden changes are averſe to Nature.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Coeleſtiall Sun cauſeth the Heliocentricall motion of the Earth, and all the Planets. The motion of the Earth upon her owne Axis, is cauſed by the Terreſtriall Sun.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Both Coeleſtial and Terreſtrial Sun joyn in the generation of things upon Earth, neither can there be any generation without both.</p>
                     <p>This will appear cleer to you, if you do but conſider, that the vitall ſpirit of all ſeeds proceeds from the Coeleſtiall Sun; but yet they muſt be ſet in the Earth, that ſo they may take the influence of the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall Sun, that ſo they may grow, and bring forth their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:170870:57"/>
                     <p>Laſtly, the Coeleſtiall Sun is in the Creation like a mighty Prince in a Kingdome, onely he is neither ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall nor covetous, nor yet will he be flattered; for as a Prince diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth offices to people, both great and ſmall offices, according as their capacity is to perform them; ſome things he acts himſelfe, ſome he permits others to act, and ſome he commands; he preſcribes one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration to one man, another office to another man, and a third to a third: Even ſo doth the Sun in the Creation; for,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He gives light to the whole Creation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He gives motion to it, whence proceeds that heat which quickens all things.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This motion heats and clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Air, from whence men and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170870:58"/>boaſts come to breath, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Latins</hi> derive <hi>Spiritus</hi> from <hi>ſpiro.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. According as this ſpirit is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or remiſſe, vehement or not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, benevolent or malevolent, according to the adminiſtration of other Planets, ſo is the qualities and appetites of things below, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute or dull, vehement or mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The truth of this is cleerly ſeen in Vegetables; for Leeks and Onyons are hot, by the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Mars;</hi> Lettice and Purſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance cold, by the adminiſtration of the Moon; Hemlock, and Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane ſtupefying, by the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saturn.</p>
                     <p>Heed this well in all your Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophicall operations.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. As in a Kingdome it lies in the power of a Prince, to redreſſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170870:58"/>what wrongs his Officers or Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrators commit upon his Subjects; ſo alſo in the Univerſe, it lies in the power of the Sun to rectifie the evil influence of the reſt of the Planets, and he will doe it to ſuch Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers as know him.</p>

                     <p>AS concerning the Moon, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to conſider,</p>
                     <p n="1">I. That by her generation is perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in all things here below, and with out her nothing can be perfected, no more then a Man could beget a Child without the help of a Woman; for though the Sun give vitall heat to the Creation, yet this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall heat will conſume, and not
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170870:60"/>preſerve, were there not radicall moyſture; for the Moon adds that moyſture to the heat of the Sun, without which the Sun could gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate nothing in the World: So alſo Philoſophers have their owne peculiar Suns and Moons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they perfect their operations; as alſo their Saturns, and their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curies.</p>
                     <p>And here let us give you war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning once more, that when Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſpeak of their <hi>Sun,</hi> or their <hi>Moon,</hi> or their <hi>Saturne,</hi> or their <hi>Mercury,</hi> they intend not the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar or common Sun and Moon, but things far different, things which are in all things, and to be found every where, but no where to be bought for money.</p>
                     <p>We dare write no plainer, ſearch them out in your ſelves, there you may ſooneſt finde them.</p>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:170870:60"/>
                     <p n="2">2. In the Habitable world ſhe anſwers to the Menſtruum of the world, and concocts it, giving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted moyſture to all Creatures, both Minerall, Animall, and Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; for as the Sun quickens them, and gives vitall heat to them, ſo the Moon ſubminiſters radicall moyſture to them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Philoſophers know how to fetch radicall moyſture in their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations from their owne Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Moon, when they can but finde her in the Philoſophicall Sea, for ſhe is not alwayes to be found there; for though the tree of the Moon alwayes grow upon the bank, yet is not the fruit at all times to be gathered.</p>
                     <p>The Poets layed downe this in ſome places very truly, though very fabulouſly. We confeſſe we cannot much blame them in ſo doing, ſince God hath opened the eyes of our

What the operation of the Moon is in the Elementary world (and Philoſophers muſt make uſe of their Philoſophicall Moon in like manner, elſe they will bring their Hogs to a fair Market) may be cleerly ſeen, if we look no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the generation of Man, in which thou mayeſt ſee a lively Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome both of the operations of the Sun and her.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In the generation of all things in the Elementary world, as the Sun gives heat, ſo the Moon gives moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and that's the reaſon that the generation and growth of all things is performed by heat and moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The truth of this is more cleerly ſhewn no where then in the Conception of Man; for the ſeed of both ſexes being mixed, the Mother furniſheth the conception
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170870:62"/>with excrementitious blood, called <hi>Menstruis,</hi> which ſhe receives by means of what food ſhe eats or drinks; which the Microcoſmicall Sun in the Embryon by his heat compels into a maſs, ferments it by concoction, and forms into the ſhape of a Man.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Juſt ſo for all the world the Moon doth in the Macrocoſme; for by her ſwift circulation about the Earth, ſhe receives the virtue of the Sun and the five Planets, from which like a Mother ſhe gives nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment and growth to things below, in the Elementary world.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Earth like a Wombe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the vitall heat of the Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall Sun, and the radicall moyſture of the Coeleſtiall Moon, which the Centrall Sun in the bowels of the Earth concocts (as the ſtomach concocts food) and makes it fit nouriſhment for the ſeverall Ideas in the Elementary world.</p>

Thus are all things in the Elementary world, both Minerals, Animals, and Vegetables, firſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Earth, till at laſt they live, and being alive, they grow to perfection, being nouriſhed by the ſame breaſts of the Sun and Moon. Heed this carefully in all Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall preparations; if you do not forget it in the ſtudy of <hi>Aurum Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabile,</hi> you cannot do amiſſe.</p>

                     <p>You ſee what low principles thoſe which our Dons account famous men, were guided by, and that they underſtood the letter, and not the meaning of Philoſophy.</p>

                     <p>IT is well knowne to all that have ſtudied <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> the Houſes of <hi>Saturn</hi> are oppoſite to the Houſes of the Luminaries, but the reaſon of this few know, <hi>viz.</hi> why <hi>Capricorn</hi> and <hi>Aquary</hi> are the Houſes of <hi>Saturn.</hi> We ſhall clear this in the firſt place, that ſo we might make way for that which followes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. You may remember we told you in the former Chapter, that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> fixes the influences both of the Sun and Moon, and ſtops the unbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled motion of their beames; for though the Sun and Moon be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of all Generation, and growth, in that ſence that the father and the mother are Authors of a Child; yet ſuch is the unequall diſpoſition of man, that unleſſe their beams were
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170870:70"/>qualified by the other Planets, they would be found to be little better then venomous, nay, perhaps the ſtrongeſt poyſon in the world. We intreat you not to miſtake us, neither the <hi>Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> whom we honour, think we ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun and Moon in the leaſt. That is properly poyſon which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imicall to a particular individuall. For example, a Toad is poyſon to a man, yet is it very good nouriſhment to a Duck, and a Duck fed with nothing but Toads and water, proves very good nouriſhment to a man. If you will not believe this, aſke the next Muſitian you meet, whether one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord will not ſweeten two diſcords, and make them harmony.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 As great a prevarication as there is between a concord and a diſcord in Muſick, is there between <hi>Saturn</hi> and the Luminaries, therefore the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, not without cauſe, place his manſions oppoſite to the Houſes of the Luminaries.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 We told you before that all things were fixed by coldneſſe and dryneſs;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170870:71"/>the next peece of Ice you ſee will prove what we ſay is truth; therefore <hi>Capricorn</hi> a cold and dry Signe, is alot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for one of his Manſions.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 But becauſe there muſt be putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the one, before there can be production of the other, therefore <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary</hi> the other houſe of <hi>Saturn,</hi> being hot and moiſt, makes them the fitter for putrifaction.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Pray to God to open the eyes of your underſtanding. <hi>Hagar</hi> could not ſee the Well before God opened her eyes: Neither could <hi>Eliſha's</hi> man ſee the Angels which compaſſed him round about. We ſhall deliver you the whole truth briefly.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 <hi>Saturn</hi> in <hi>Capricorn,</hi> and <hi>Aquary,</hi> fixes the beams of the Luminaries, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> in <hi>Piſces</hi> putrifies them, <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Aries</hi> calcines them, <hi>Venus</hi> in <hi>Taurus</hi> makes them fruitfull, <hi>Mercury</hi> in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi> indues them with a ſpirit; Is it poſſible an <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> ſhould live halfe a year, and not give the Moral to this Fable?</p>
                     <p n="7">7 But we muſt recall our thoughts
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170870:71"/>to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who preſently ſteps in and begins to putrifie what <hi>Saturn</hi> hath fixed, and that's the reaſon <hi>Sagitarius</hi> and <hi>Piſces</hi> were alotted for his Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe they are contignous to the houſes of <hi>Saturn</hi> in each ſide, and they caſt Trine to the houſes of each Luminary, whereby they aſſiſting <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> them, a putrifaction cannot chuſe but be made, and being made, be turned to a very good uſe.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 We care not greatly now if we tell you why <hi>Jupiter</hi> is called a fortune, he is a Star hot and moiſt in quality; or to ſpeak more like Philoſophers, his <hi>Radij</hi> hot and moiſt; for one Star is as hot and as cold as another: And becauſe he agrees with the Sun in heat, and the Moon in moiſture</p>

                     <p n="11">11 We can teach men no better way what the wonderfull works of God in the Creation are, then by bringing them home to their owne bodies; and this was the reaſon that wiſe man, whom our Prieſts call a Heathen, we mean <hi>Solon,</hi> ſaid, <hi>The firſt step to knowledge was for a man to know himſelfe.</hi> The meat being taken down into the ſtomack, <hi>Saturn</hi> fixeth it there, and putrifies it by meditation of the Spleen, and turns it into ſuch a naſty, loathſome, and venomous quality, as
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170870:72"/>would turne the ſtrongeſt ſtomack to ſmell to; this loathſome ſtuffe <hi>Jupiter</hi> takes and concocts againe, and by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of the Liver turns it into moſt pure blood, which afterwards <hi>Mars</hi> calcines, as we ſhall ſhew by and by.</p>
                     <p n="12">12 We told you before that all things were generated by the Sun and Moon, then which nothing is truer; yet are not the other Planets uſeleſſe, as we ſhall explain a little, becauſe upon this depends the key of the whole work, as in the body of man; for a plainer and more familiar exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cannot be; it is the Microcoſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Sun and Moon which beget their like, and cheriſh it being begotten; yet they make uſe of certaine veſſels to ferment the ſeed of others to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct it, of a third ſort to keep it being concocted, and of a fourth to caſt it out, juſt ſo for all the world doth the Celeſtiall Sun and Moon in genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting things here below, and ſo muſt Philoſophers alſo in their operations, or elſe they will make nine pences, and when they expect the harveſt of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170870:73"/>all their paines and care, they will ſet downe and ſcratch their heads with a paire of fools nailes: We dare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the way will ſcarce ever be taught plainer; when you want any thing in your operation, look for it in your ſelves, you may ſooner find a thing in the Epitomy, then in the Text.</p>
                     <p n="13">13 Thus you ſee that whatſoever rayes the Luminaries let fall upon the earth; after <hi>Saturn</hi> hath fixed and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified them, <hi>Jupiter</hi> by his friendly and temperate beams concocts them, and from being venemous makes them wholſome and healthfull.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. V. OF MARS.</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi>MArs</hi> though he be commonly called an infortune, yet if his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations be heedfully viewed, you ſhall find him as helpfull to Nature, and by conſequence to all hermetique preparations (of which <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> is one of the greateſt, neither ſhall it yeeld in dignity to any, the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſtone excepted,) as any of the reſt of the planets, and indeed if we ſhould ſpeak the truth, we muſt tell you really we do not know that the influence of one planet is more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary then the influence of another, but to come home to <hi>Mars,</hi> who elſe would be angry, we deſire you to conſider.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 After <hi>Saturn</hi> hath fixed and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied things in Nature, and <hi>Jupiter</hi> lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the foundation of their Vegetable growth, <hi>Mars</hi> comes in and blowes the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170870:75"/>Bellowes hard, that ſo he may increaſe the heat, and this doth a Philoſopher two notable good turnes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 It calcines his matter, that ſo by a ſecond production in may be made better th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n it was at the firſt. An Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymiſt will tell how much calcin'd Vitriol is ſtronger then crude; and a Sope-boyler can tell you how much calcin'd Aſhes are ſtronger then others.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 It urgeth on all things to moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by Philoſophicall motion Philoſophicall time is found out, even as the time of the day is found out by the ſeeming motion of the Sun; This you will confeſſe to be a truth, if you doe but conſider, that when you are angry, your thoughts are ſwifter and quicker by half, then they are when you are pleaſed. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 <hi>Mars</hi> clarifies that putrifaction which <hi>Jupiter</hi> cauſeth in his digeſtion, and makes all things fluid in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of man. There is ſcarce a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian breathing, though he be never ſo
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170870:75"/>great a Dunce, but he knowes this well enough, that the blood in our bodies is clarified and made fluid by Chollor; and if he doe ſo in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocoſm, Philoſophy will teach any one that knowes what it is, that it muſt of neceſſity doe the ſame in the Macrocoſm.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 By his heat he is aſſiſtant in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing vital heat to the Creation, and urgeth forward the motion of the rayes of the Sun; this we ſuppoſe to be the reaſon why Aſtrologers ſay, <hi>He is the Suns Captaine Generall,</hi> and why the Sun is exalted in his houſe; It is pity Aſtrologers ſtudy Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy no more, that they might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be able to give a reaſon for their own Principles.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Becauſe he is hot and dry, he is Diametricall oppoſite to the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Moone, and therefore he calcines and clarifies the radicall moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture both in the Macrocoſm, and in the Microcoſm; he alſo cauſeth it to keep its Center, that ſo it may not diſſipate it ſelfe too much, or in plain
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170870:76"/>tearms, exhauſt it ſelfe all in ſeed; nay more then that, that which will ſeem ſtranger, it fortifies radicall moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, by oppoſing it, for indeed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oppoſition the world could not ſubſiſt, becauſe it conſiſts of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties; and therefore the one muſt needs ſtrengthen the other, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it to make head againſt what op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth it; and this need be doubtfull to none that ever ſate ſtill and blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fire.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 As all things are bred and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by heat and moyſture, as they are fixed by coldneſſe and dryneſſe, as we told you before: So in the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Generation in man, there muſt needs be ſome exſuperance or aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, this <hi>Mars</hi> by his heat exhales, and converts into excrements, that ſo they may be caſt out from the pure.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 He heats and quickens the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the other Planets, and ſtirs them up to action; he is amongſt the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets like a Criminall Magiſtrate in a Common-wealth, he puniſheth their ſlackneſſe, and ſeeth they be not idle.</p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:170870:76"/>
                     <p n="7">7 We care not greatly if we give a reaſon why at the firſt <hi>Mars</hi> came to be called an infortune, or at leaſt-wiſe what we conceive to be the reaſon, what is this, Becauſe by his congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity with the Sun he either increaſeth the vitall ſpirit in quantity, or maketh it too hot in quality; a ſtrange poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; let us ſee if we can make it good. To effect which, conſider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That there might be no confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in thoſe active cauſes, the firſt Principles, becauſe they are contrary the one to the other, and therefore knowne Enemies; but that all things may flow from one head, as God is one, therefore God drew all the force of working, and virtue of begetting into one narrow round compaſſe, and this is that which we call the Sun.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 This he placed in the Centre of the Creation, that from thence his virtue might be ſent out, ſpread, and beſtowed equally about the world, to make one generall heat, light, life, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and cauſe of all things.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 God caſt in the knowne foure
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170870:77"/>fighting enemies, <hi>viz.</hi> The Elements, and ſet all the reſt of the Creation in a reſtleſſe race too and fro, this way and that way, that ſo by their various influences upon contrary qualities, there might be a continuall change of things here below, that ſo man ſhould Centre in nothing but in God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, when he ſees all other things are ſubject to change.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 After God had done ſo, he crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man after his owne Image, and infuſed a ſpirit into him, cloathed with a fine windy coat of the cleaneſt ſuper-celeſtial Aire, from that place which Philoſophers call <hi>Aether,</hi> if you will from the third Heavens.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 In the Generation of man, when our life in the luſting parts thereof, is by the bellowes of thought ſtirred up and moved to action; it ſends forth out of every part of the body the hot naturall ſpirit, or breath of begetting cloathed with a Garment of ſeed, which is cut out from the dewy part of our meat, ready to be turned into our own like, if not already turning.</p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:170870:77"/>
                     <p n="6">6 Give us leave here a little by the way, to have one word or two with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who is not aſhamed to aver That the ſeed of man is an excrement, whereas if it were our buſineſſe in hand, we could eaſily prove that it is the beſt juyce in all our body, and the fineſt workmanſhip which is made of all our food, and that's the reaſon the immoderate uſe of Venery weakens Nature ſo much. But to proceed.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 This fine Oyle or food of life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it hath remained forty dayes in the double naturall heat of the begetting ſpirit and the womb, is formed and faſhioned into the ſhape of a man.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 Now is radicall moyſture at its full growth and perfection, and daily decreaſes, even to the time of diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the Child in the womb is put over by Nature for the reſt of its nouriſhment, to the Menſtru's of the mother, and ſhe can add nothing to the food of life, if ſhe could, a man might live for ever, ſhe onely adds to the increaſe of the body.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 As mans body lives by food, ſo
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170870:78"/>doth the ſpirit alſo, and conſumes the radicall moyſture, which is indeed its proper food, and when it hath conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that, ſometimes it conſumes the body alſo, as is evidently ſeene in Hectique Feavers.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 To make this evident by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; No longer then you add combuſtible matter to the fire, no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will that burn, but goes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately out, ſo ſoon as that is conſumed, even ſo the fine Aetheriall ſpirit of man feeds upon that fine fatneſſe which is indeed its food, and in truth his tye to the body of man, which is commonly called radicall moyſture; and when he hath conſumed it, away flies he as faſt as be came, and leaves his old Hoſt at ſix and ſeavens.</p>
                     <p n="11">11 Then we intreat you to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſo we have done, that if the vitall ſpirit be not great, a little radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call moyſture will ſerve the turne, for its food, and out of the ſlack working of them, ſmall ſtore of refuſe breath and ſmoke ariſeth, to make any great need of freſh and open aire to cleanſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>d feed them, as it appears in Flyes,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170870:78"/>which live all the winter without aire; but if the vitall heat be great and lively, great ſtore of radicall moyſture is required to feed it.</p>
                     <p n="12">12 Thus you have the reaſon, as we conceive, why <hi>Mars</hi> was at the firſt accounted a malignant, becauſe he increaſeth the violence of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall heat, and thereby the ſooner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth radicall moyſture, to which he is inimicall, and ſo cauſeth death. But to proceed.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 <hi>Mars</hi> hath alſo his faults in all Philoſophicall preparations, and thoſe not a few; we ſhall give them Phiſically, as we did the former, and leave every man to be his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter; and we ſhall be pretty large in them, becauſe they are more ſubject to Philoſophicall operations, or at leaſt Philoſophicall operations are more ſubject to them, then to the faults of all the reſt of the Planets, for by his intemperate heat and torrid dryneſſe, he cauſeth many vices both to the body and mind of man, as alſo to Hermeticall operation, which you may eaſily perceive by what followes.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. VI. OF VENUS.</head>
                     <p>THe chief operation of <hi>Mars</hi> in the Common-wealth of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is by his heat to prepare and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine matter for ſeed, which <hi>Venus</hi> comes afterwards, which by her kind moiſture makes fruitfull; and this is the Morall of thoſe Poeticall Fables of the adultery of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are both ſo infinite neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, both for the making of ſeed, and Generation of man; for as <hi>Mars</hi> by his exceeding heat and dryneſs tends but little to Generation, but burnes rather than cheriſheth, calcines rather then quickens, ſo <hi>Venus</hi> being cold and moiſt, tends not at all to Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without the help of <hi>Mars;</hi> for all Generation is performed by heat and moiſture.</p>
                     <p>Let us now ſee a little Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally how we can make <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:170870:80"/>agree in Philoſophicall prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and we will give it you onely by a parallel taken from our own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, therefore be pleaſed to conſider,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 All the quoile and fighting in a mans body which cauſeth him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be merrie, ſometimes ſad, ſometimes loving, ſometimes hating, ſomtimes joyous, ſomtimes grievous, ſometimes angry, ſometimes pleaſed, ſometimes ſick, and ſometimes in health, together with all the other changes in a mans life, proceeds from the fighting and quarrelling of thoſe foure firſt knowne enemies within him, <hi>viz.</hi> Heat, Coldneſſe, Drineſſe, and Moiſture, and he that knowes how this comes to paſſe in man, who is a perfect and compleat Microcoſm, may eaſily know how this comes to paſſe in the world, and what the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is that men fall out, and fight, and kill one another; whereas nature teacheth men to love &amp; preſerve one another; and he that knowes it in the Microcoſm, or Macrocoſm, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it not in Philoſophy, is not like to be taught by us.</p>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:170870:81"/>
                     <p n="2">2 Theſe foure firſt Principles, or noted Enemies, which you will, which can never be reconciled if the ſtrength of one of them be never ſo little greater then the ſtrength of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, he ſubdues, digeſteth, and turneth them into his owne Nature, he eats them up, and is ſtrengthned by them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 But if his unlikes and contraries be equall in power with him, and ſo prove his matches, then neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth each other, but both ſtand amazed and dulled; and this is that they call an equall mixture of the foure firſt Principles, and by this equall mixture our life and health is maintained.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 For example; Fire which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hot, and ſomething dry withall, and water which is very cold, and moiſt withall, if both theſe be in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall power in mans body, they dull the violence of one another, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of both can be loſt or deſtroyed, but if this water by heat of the fire (it being too ſtrong for it) be turned
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170870:81"/>into aire, then it is partly like the fire, and if it be not friendly to it, yet at leaſt-wiſe it is its weaker foe, and ſo yields to it, and ſtrengthens the nature of the fire, for all Alchymiſts know, that the more aire you give the fire, the more fairer it burns; but if this aire gets more watery moiſture and coldneſſe, as is clearly ſeen in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and foggy weather, it will eaſily overcome the fire, and eat him up, and that's the reaſon foggy weather makes men cough, by breathing in a moiſt aire.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Now the harmony of the world conſiſts by a conſent or dulling of the foure firſt famous Enemies, even as Muſick is a harmony made by conſent of concords, and diſcords; for when this harmony between the foure firſt Principles, is in the leaſt broken, they begin to ſtir and fight and ſtrive for ſuperiority, till at laſt one conquers the reſt; this is that which in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies we call paine and diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 At laſt when one firſt Principle gets the Lordſhip and dominion over
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170870:82"/>all the reſt, he turns them all into his own nature, and then the old conſent and knot of life is broken, loſt, and ſpoyled, and ſtill goes downward till man return to the earth from whence he came.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 To give you an example of this in a dead man.</p>
                     <p>1 When the breath is out of the body, the naturall fire waxeth luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm preſently, and in a ſhort time is devoured by aire.</p>
                     <p>2 The aire preſently waxeth thick, cold, and watriſh, putrifies, and by putrifaction breeds a Generation of Vermine, and preſently vaniſheth in a watry filth.</p>
                     <p>3 The water waxeth dry and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, and ſtill dryer and dryer, till it be all devoured by earth, from whence man ſet forth at beginning.</p>
                     <p>We have now ſhewed, and we hope ſufficiently too, the Reaſons of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite qualities of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unleſſe they were oppoſite, and equally oppoſite in the acting and generating of things here below, the

                     <p n="2">2. As the Celeſtiall Sun makes uſe of the heat of <hi>Mars</hi> to calcine things and fit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="3">3. Conſidering what an antipathy there is between <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> and yet what a ſimpathy they hold one
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170870:83"/>with another in generation, you may eaſily find out the reaſon of that ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy and antipathy of things gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
                     <p n="4">4.

                     <p>WEE told you in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, That God had Created a Three-fold world, Elementary, Celeſtiall, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual, which laſt is the higheſt in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170870:89"/>dignity, and thrice happy is he that attaines to the right knowledge of it. This he whoever intends to attaine the Divine Myſteries in Philoſophy, muſt not be ignorent of; for,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Of theſe three worlds every infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour is Governed by its ſuperiour, and receives all its power and virtue from the influence and rayes thereof; for God the great firſt being, and chief worker of all things, governs the Celeſtiall world by the Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall or Aetheriall: The Stars keep their conſtancy in motion by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of the Angels; and he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the Elementary world by the Celeſtiall Elementary bodies, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vegetable, animall, or minerall, are governed by the Stars. One ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and no more winters, are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to teſtifie the truth of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Conſider, that the vertue and knowledge of all Elementary things comes to us from God by degrees, by many and equall ſteps which we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe God did in mercy to man, that ſo by the ſame progreſſion we might
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170870:90"/>climb up to the knowledge both of our God, and our ſelves; for the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of all things comes from God to the Angels, from the Angels to the Stars, from the Stars to the Elements, and Elementary bodies.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The ready way for man to climb up to the top of this knowledge, is by the ſame ſteps and degrees this knowledge comes downe unto us, beginning at the lower end of the ladder, <hi>viz.</hi> the Elements, and climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up by ſteps to the top, <hi>viz.</hi> the Intellectuall or Aetheriall world: But withall have a care one foot be faſt before you remove the other; we mean, take heed of building upon rotten foundations, believe nothing becauſe we or others write it, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine it firſt, whether it be poſſible in nature or not, if not, there is ſome myſticall meaning in it, ſearch that out diligently.

                     <p>THat God doth ſome things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, over now in this declining Age of the world, is a truth ſo manifeſt, that we ſuppoſe no Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi-man now living, be he Epiſcopall, Preſbyterian, or Independant, we ſuppoſe will once offer to deny: As alſo, that God out of grace and love to thoſe that fear him, beſtowes many influences or beames of Heavenly knowledge upon ſuch, more then upon others; which made a great Philoſopher ſay, <hi>The Judgements of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170870:93"/>the Lord are a great depth, yea, I have infinitely admired at Divine providence, in my greateſt misfortunes; for I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes had the protection of our great Creator at hand, and the Angel of the Lord of this Treaſury have been alwayes my keeper.</hi> And a little after he ſaith, <hi>So great bleſſings have I received from the moſt high God our Creator, that it is impoſſible not onely for my pen, but alſo for my mind to comprehend. God ſcarce ever conferred to any mortall man greater things then he hath done upon me.</hi> And a little after that, he ſaith, <hi>Thou that deſirest to attaine this Art, in the firſt place put thy whole truſt in God thy Creator, for it is a vaine thing to truſt in Princes, they are but men, ſeeke God by prayer, and then aſſuredly believe that he will not forſake thee; for when God knoweth that thy heart is ſincere, and thy whole truſt is put in him, he will by one means or another, ſhew thee a way, and aſſiſt thee in it, that thou ſhalt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thy deſire. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wiſedome.</hi> And truly this we can ſay by experience, that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170870:93"/>had it not been for Divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in inſtructing us in a ſpeciall way, but in what manner we know not, we had never attained to it our ſelves: We wiſh that we had ſo much wiſedome and affection, that we could render due thanks to him.</p>
                     <p>This is ſufficient to prove that there is an Aetheriall or Intellectuall knowledge requiſite to ſuch as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the ſtudy of this deep Myſtery. We are not writing Divinity, as we told you, but Philoſophy, therefore expect not that we ſhould teach you what God is, nor of what materialls the body of Angel conſiſteth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we ſhall onely meddle with Divinity ſo far forth as it is of neceſſity to be knowne and acknowledged of ſuch as intend the ſtudy of <hi>Aurum Potabile,</hi> in which ſtudies thou muſt diligently weigh:</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That there is one God, a unity in the Godhead, and a Trinity in that unity; for in the right knowledge of this depends all the knowledge of the Saints, both in this world or that to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170870:94"/>come. This is the key of all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which alone muſt let thee in to the ſecret Chambers of wiſedome and knowledge here, and eternall glory hereafter. We confeſſe we have heard much talk, both in Pulpits and out of them, of a Trinity, but all the reall knowledge we had of it, we had it from God himſelfe: Yet in this let us give you a Caution or two, if it be three, it makes no great matter.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Take heed of making Riddles of the Trinity, in thinking of it ſome ſtrange and unheard of thing that never was known nor never can be; for if thou art a Saint thou art united to the father by the perſon of the Son, and the Spirit dwelleth within thee; therefore God who is goodneſſe it ſelfe, will not deny thee the knowledg of himſelfe; <hi>For this is eternall life, to know him the onely true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent;</hi> and the way how to come by this knowledge, thou haſt, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. <hi>If any of you lack wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170870:94"/>it ſhall be given him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 Do not make non ſenſe of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, by conceiting the Trinity to be 3 ſeverall perſons, as we are, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts doe, who faigned God to be an old man ſitting in Heaven, with long armes that can reach all about the world, and Jeſus Chriſt a little boy ſitting at his right hand, and the Holy Ghoſt a Dove ſitting between them. It is very like <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was of this opinion, when he made that non ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall thing which he called his Creed.</p>

This is the firſt Principle in Divinity thou muſt not be ignorant of.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 Although the true underſtanding of the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis</hi> be the radix and ground-work of all the knowledge in the world, and the deep myſteries of it underſtood by few, if by any, yet ſomething of it muſt be known by him who intends the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of this Medicine: We deſire of God to direct us in this ſo hard a taſk, that we may wright with ſuch diſcretion, thoſe men which can uſe it, and are worthy of it, may ſee the truth, and the reſt may be blinded. The wiſeſt way we can direct you in, is this, Compare what we wright, with what the Spirit of God did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite in that firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and ſee how they agree.</p>
                     <p>The firſt beginning of all things which the Scripture tells you, was
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170870:95"/>
                        <hi>without form, and voyd,</hi> which Authors call <hi>Chaos,</hi> or confuſion, was a Divine work of the Trinity, performed in a moſt wonderfull and unconceiveable manner, before there was any ſuch thing as Nature created, the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this into this preſent glorious form in which now it is, was acted by the Spirit of God in ſuch a way as we conceive God hath in no wiſe hid from the Children of men, neither is it out of their capacity, as the former was, therefore we conceive</p>
                     <p n="1">1 In the beginning the onely great and wiſe God exalted the Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or purity out of the <hi>Chaos,</hi> and having circled it round made it the outmoſt bounds of all things: This being pure, can indure no impurity, and therefore keeps all impure things within it ſelfe, and in its proper bounds; this is that <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> as we ſuppoſe, and from him our Divines call <hi>Calum Empyreum,</hi> which they ſay is the ſeat of the bleſſed ſoules, if a man were ſo mad as to believe them. It is a ſtrange thing men of that Coat
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170870:96"/>ſhould ſay <hi>Aristotle</hi> was a Heathen, and yet teach ſuch notions for pure Divinity.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall onely relate one ſtory which one of us heard from a Prieſts mouth in a Pulpit, who taking occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſpeak of the Imperiall Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, affirmed, <hi>That they were ſquare, and therefore he ſaid a ſquare form was the exacteſt.</hi> We wonder how he came by that notion, conſidering a round form is the firſt in forms. Is the Preaching of ſuch notions the way to convert ſoules? Or doth it deſerve Tithes think you?</p>
                     <p n="2">2 But to proced. After this, God lifted up the pureſt ſubſtance of fire (for one fire is purer then another, as we ſhall ſhew by and by) above all things, and placed it next unto the pure quinteſſence, above deſcribed.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 God kindled a fire in the midſt of the <hi>Chaos,</hi> in the very Centre of it, and this is that we commonly call the Sun, which diſtilled up thoſe moſt pure waters which were next to the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170870:96"/>former pure fire deſcribed; this we conceive to be that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Chriſtalline Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; for the true meaning of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Philoſophers being not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> muſt do ſomthing to get him a name, having all the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Philoſophers, ſo far as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Tyrant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, delivered to him, and he read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much in an houre, as would coſt a wiſe man two year to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, invented this name of Chriſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Heavens, which is now quoted as a piece of Divinity.</p>

We hope we may uſe the name worlds in the Plurall number without offence, becauſe the Scripture doth it, as may appear if you read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. &amp; 11.3.</p>

                     <p n="6">6 The Centrall fire in the worlds never ceaſeth working, but is ſtill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling water into aire, which becauſe it cannot exceed its bounds, is turned agen into water, and this is that which cauſeth rain, ſo that there is a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall circulation in the Elementary world.</p>

                     <p n="1">1 Doe not account Riches the greateſt things, neither let them take up the beſt and choiceſt of thy thoughts. When <hi>Solomon</hi> was put to his choice what he would deſire, he deſired knowledge, and not Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, God gave it him, and Riches to boot, and he is the ſame God ſtill.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 There is a mighty uncertainty in Riches, but there is none at all in Knowledge. Look upon this Nation at this preſent, and you may ſee the truth of it through a paire of ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles glaſſed with an inch board.</p>

                     <p n="3">3 It's the fooliſheſt thing in the world for a man to ſpend the ſtrength of an immortall ſpirit in gathering earth together, it transformes a man into a Hogge, as the Poets ſay, <hi>Cerse</hi> did <hi>

                     <p>One of us heard lately of a Lady that had a vaſt Eſtate that was ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted with folly, that ſhe would get up into the Coach box, and drive the Horſes, and the Coach-man rode in the Coach: This was a madneſs you will ſay, yet is the madneſſe as far greater, and ſurpaſſeth it as much as eternall life doth this, for a man whom God hath united unto himſelf to make himſelf a ſlave to the world.</p>

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170870:103"/>heaven, know they are riſen from the earth with Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 All the changes and chances in this world move them not; they can be as comfortable and as joyfull in the loſſe of all, as in the enjoyment of it. The reproaches and ſcandalls of the men of this world, which are but the Embrions of the idle braines of time, are great comforts to them, they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of them as badges of their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, becauſe they are ſo uſed as Chriſt and his Apoſtles were at his birth.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The joyes of Heaven are alway preſent before their eyes, ſo that they fear not death.</p>
                     <p>It was a moſt excellent ſpeech of a Philoſopher, and a great one in his time, <hi>Believe me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if I were not a man of that ranke and condition as I am, nothing would be more pleaſant to me then a ſolitary life, or with</hi> Diogenes <hi>to lye hid under a Tub, for I ſee all things to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170870:104"/>be but vanity, and that deceit and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe are altogether in uſe, where all things are to be bought and ſold, and that vice doth excell virtue; I ſee the better things of the life to come, before mine eyes, and rejoyce in theſe.</hi> And now I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not, as before I did, why Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers have not cared to have their dayes ſhortned, becauſe every Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher hath a life to come ſo clearly ſet before his eyes, as thy face is in a glaſſe. And ſo give us leave to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this ſecond point, with this ſacred and Divine ſpeech of a noble Lord now deceaſed, whoſe name we are forbidden in his writings to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 There remaines but one more, and that is this, Labour to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in your preſent conditions. Diſcontent makes a good condition bad, content makes a bad condition good. Doe not onely ſeem to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, but be ſo really; be not ſo by conſtraint, but willingly; and give us leave to tell you</p>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:170870:104"/>
                     <p n="1">1 There is an emptineſſe in the Creature, yea, ſuch an emptineſſe as is uncapable to ſatisfie the better part of man, neither is it any way ſuitable to it. The ſpirit of man is Aetheriall,☞ and the ſoule of man Celeſtiall, and this world Elementary, therefore that part of this world which ſatisfies a man, muſt firſt be brought by Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophicall Art to a Celeſtiall, and then to an Etheriall conſtitution, before it can ſatisfie the better part of man.</p>
                     <p>I have read of one covetous Prince who imployed all his ſubjects in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging up Gold Mines, inſomuch that he left not ſufficient to till the earth; on a time when he went to dinner, his wife furniſhed his table all with gold, the poor man being hungry calls for victuals, his wife told him ſhe had no other Victualls but gold, and withall, if he did not ſuffer his ſubjects to till the earth, he muſt in a very ſhort time either eat gold or ſtarve. Alſo a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miniſter, now dead, upon the ſame
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170870:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>occaſion, brings this Simely, Suppoſe a man is hungry, and to ſatisfie his craving ſtomach, ſhould gape with his mouth to take in aire, and think he is not ſatisfied becauſe he hath not aire enough, when indeed the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is becauſe it is not ſutable to his ſtomach; and yet as ſutable as the things of this world are to the ſoul or ſpirit of man.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 This content muſt of neceſſity make things worſe, but it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it ſhould make them one jot better. If a Maſter of a Ship when he is at Sea in a ſtorm, ſhould walk up and down in a diſcontented mood, fretting, and fuming, and ſcratching his head, and not give order to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Ship, were not his danger much greater? And ſo truly it is with diſcontented people, they make the matter worſe, but cannot make it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The whole world is governed by
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170870:105"/>viciſſitude and change of times; there is a winter as well as a ſummer; a night as well as a day in the Creation, why therefore ſhould not we expect adverſity, as well as proſperity?</p>
                     <p>'Twas an excellent ſpeech of a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher; ſaith he, <hi>If thou wouldeſt ſubject all things to thy ſelfe, firſt ſubject thy ſelfe to reaſon.</hi> And <hi>Theodotius</hi> who once had been a King, and afterwards diſpoſſeſſed of his Kingdome, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in a mean eſtate, one aſkt him what he had gotten by all his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy which he had gotten, ſeeing he could not keep his Kingdome by it, <hi>I have gotten this,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I can live as contentedly without my Kingdome, as with it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4 Take but a little notice what a baſe thing diſcontent is, how diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable it is to a man, much more to a Saint.</p>
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:170870:106"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> mentions a certain peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who to manifeſt their diſdaine they bore to ſuch as were dejected in ſpirit, for outward loſſes, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to goe in a certaine time in womens Apparrell, in token of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, becauſe they have ſo unman'd themſelves to be diſcontented.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Diſcontent makes a man more like an Antick, then like a man: Look but upon a diſcontented ſoul the next time you ſee him, and you ſhall ſee what a behaviour, what an unſeemly carriage, inſomuch that they are burdenſome to our beſt friends.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 And laſtly, It is a great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to the enjoyment of Gods mercies, of which we account this we treat of, none of the leaſt. You will not give your Children any thing whilſt they cry, neither will God you.</p>
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:170870:106"/>
                     <p>It was an excellent ſpeech of a Miniſter now living, <hi>The Spirit of God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>never reſteth upon an angry, or a diſcontented ſoule.</hi>

               <head>THE Concluſion.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU have, Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader, heard a Diſcourſe of the three Worlds, and foure Elements, and that to no other end then to let you know, You muſt be ſeen in them before you undertake ſo ſublime a buſineſſe in hand: To let you know that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
<pb facs="tcp:170870:107"/>are included under the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſalls.</p>
               <p>That in and to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of the <hi>Aur: Potabile</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a ſerious contemplative and active ſpirit.</p>
               <p>And to let you know, though not ſo much what is, yet what is not to be uſed, but ſhunned and avoided.</p>
               <p>In the proceſſe of which, truly we wiſh you Happy Arrivall too.</p>
               <p>And to let you know, That it's a Univerſall Worke that's begun when ever you begin it, and a worke whoſe attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lyes in the way to a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſcrutiny, and further procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>
               <p>It is not every precipitating
<pb facs="tcp:170870:108"/>coriſive thing that will doe it; not every thing that reduces the Philoſophers living gold to a ſoluble ſubſtance: Not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive fire, but ſuch a fire as <hi>Pontanus</hi> deſcribes, though in our Judgements his Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the fire is the moſt Enigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically deſcribed of any Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher that writes. Such a radicall Humidity and Menſtrum muſt be had whereof Gold had its Originall: I mean in reſpect of Tincture, not of Baſis, which received but of Tincture which were given by Natures Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrator.</p>
               <p>But here ſome may object, and ſay,</p>
               <p>That <hi>You tell us no more then what Ancient Philoſophers
<pb facs="tcp:170870:108"/>have long agoe wrote, ſo that wee are no neerer then wee were.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which we Anſwer, That though at the firſt ſight we doe not, therefore for a helpe to that, we uſe not ſo many Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles and Aenigma's in the whole, as many others have done.</p>
               <p>Beſides, let us tell you, that he whoever it is that once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines the right Proceſſe, can write no otherwiſe then others have done before him, unleſſe it may be in ſome one word or two; for which cauſe Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers ſayings are diligently and ſeriouſly to be enquired into, and in that word or two a diligent mind may attaine the whole proceſſe.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:170870:109"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wee confeſſe it's an old ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That better is the good the more common it is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which we Anſwer, That if this Jewell fall into ſuch hands, by that means of community as may and will doe hurt, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe good, the Queſtion is already anſwered.</p>
               <p>For the greateſt bleſſings e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver turne the greateſt curſes, if not well and warily uſed.</p>
               <p>To conclude, We have not much to ſay, but onely to crave every mans gentle acceptance of what we have ſaid, and more eſpecially what we ſhall now ſay, We exhort every one that hath a Philoſophicall faith (and no other man) to read the writings of Philoſophers, and meaſure
<pb facs="tcp:170870:109"/>them all according to Natures univerſall and generall courſe of Creation, Preſervation, Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and Reſtitution of things Naturall; and not to truſt one word of their ſayings unleſſe he can find ſome fundamentall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime of Nature to ſecond it. Let him have a pure contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative mind, and truſt in the Eternall Eſſence of all things, and take this one thing along, and that's worth all that hath been yet ſaid, That unleſſe the Art be revealed him by a friend, he ſhall not attaine it by that manner of Knowledge and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with which he firſt began the ſtudy.</p>
               <p>But this is not to dehort any man from its ſtudy, but to him
<pb facs="tcp:170870:110"/>that truly underſtands it's the greateſt of all Comforts and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements; for while by his contemplation and earneſt ſtudy he finds himſelfe to be below, and unable, and unworthy of what he ſeekes: Behold the Angel of this Treaſury of God Eternall reveales it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gentle Reader,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is but a Theory, but know well that it muſt be gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before the Praxis, which will ſhortly be diſcovered, with many other things needfull and uſefull to the wiſe, to the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh a ſnare; yea, ſuch things as may reduce all labour to an end: This is no Prophecy.</p>
